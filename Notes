-You may have to play around with the file locations. Ideally this would've been implemented into a GUI in which there would be an 
input button so as to robustly deal with the problem.

-The options currently set are the default options for the cell images. If results are undesireable it is worth playing around with
these option parameters in an effort to conform more to your images. The meanings of the options are included to the right in the code.

-The scaling factor is in place in order to more accurately deal with exremely sharp curves. The higher the number the higher the
computation time, so if the images of question do not have sharp angles it makes sense to lower the scaling number (with 1 for a circle).

-uncomment/comment whichever block is desireable (curvature on top of BW masks or on top of raw cell images).
